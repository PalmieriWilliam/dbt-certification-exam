# dbt certification study guide

This a comprehensive study guide I created while preparing for the **dbt Analytics Engineering Certification Exam**. 

Itâ€™s organised by topic, following the structure of the certification, from dbt fundamentals to more advanced stuff like testing, materializations, and deployments. I also included some extra notes and video summaries that helped me during my prep.

If you're studying for the exam or just want to deepen your understanding of dbt, feel free to use it!
